## Kaizo IronMon Ruleset

These additional rules are meant to be insanely stupid and hard. These are not meant to be fair, and possibly not even
fun. But if you are truly someone who wants an impossible challenge, this is for you. These rules are also
non-negotiable. If you wish to adjust rules just play Standard Ironmon and Ultimate as your ruleset.
